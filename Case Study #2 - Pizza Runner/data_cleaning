Data Cleaning Steps – Pizza Runner






Introduction

Before performing any SQL analysis for the Pizza Runner dataset, it was crucial to clean and standardize the data.

The dataset contained multiple tables:

customer_orders

runner_orders

pizza_recipes

pizza_names

pizza_toppings

runners

Common issues included:

Multiple values in a single cell (violating SQL atomicity)

Blank or inconsistent entries

Textual "null" instead of SQL NULL

Incorrect data types for numeric columns (distance, duration)

This document outlines the detailed cleaning steps, reasoning, methods used (Excel & SQL), and example code for each table.
